# DjangoHouseApp
App made in Django, which uses Bootstrap, PostgresSQL and Nginx. Website is an estate agents site, which uses listings from a Postgres database 
to display on the domain. There is an admin page, which has been set up with the database, so that users can add houses or estate agents.

Producing this django app taught me how to integrate a front-end product with the back-end solutions provided by Django, use of the UNIX terminal as well as remote accessing a Linux server on Digital Ocean, and how to create and use a Postgresql data base, that serves dynamic content to the front end UI.

The website is fully functional, and was made following the [Traversy Media tutorial on Udemy](https://traversymedia.com/).
