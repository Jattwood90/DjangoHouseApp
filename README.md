# DjangoHouseApp
App made in Django, which uses Bootstrap, PostgresSQL and Nginx. Website is an estate agents site, which uses listings from a Postgres database 
to display on the domain. There is a back-end admin page, which has been set up with the database, so that users can add houses or estate agents.

Producing this django app taught me how to integrate a front-end product with the back-end solutions provided by Django, and use of the UNIX terminal. To host the project I used SSH to connect with a remote Linux Ubuntu server, in order to transfer the Django project, and database to the Digital Ocean cloud server.

The website is fully functional, and was made following the [Traversy Media tutorial on Udemy](https://traversymedia.com/).
